                    <li>Chopped parsley or nuts (optional, for garnish)</li>

            <h4>Steps to Prepare:-</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Meat:</li>

                <small>In a large pot, heat the ghee or clarified butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent.
                Add the lamb chunks to the pot and brown them on all sides.</small>

                <li>Prepare the Mansaf Sauce:</li>

                <small>In a separate bowl, mix the plain yogurt with minced garlic, turmeric, cardamom, and cinnamon.
                Pour the yogurt mixture over the browned lamb in the pot.</small>

                <li>Simmer the Mansaf:</li>

                <small>Add enough water to cover the meat in the pot. Season with salt according to your taste.
                Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer, partially covered, for about 1.5 to 2 hours or until the meat becomes tender. Stir occasionally.</small>

                <li>Assemble and Serve:</li>

                <small>Traditionally, Mansaf is served on a large platter with a base of cooked rice or bulgur.
                Arrange the cooked rice or bulgur on the serving platter.
                Once the meat is tender, transfer it with the yogurt sauce onto the bed of rice or bulgur, covering it generously.</small>
                
                <li>Garnish and Serve:</li>

                <small>Optional: Garnish the Mansaf with chopped parsley or nuts for added flavor and presentation.</small>
